This is an R Markdown document. 
THis document looks at the steps taken in the study found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip

The following questions are explored:
What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
What is the average daily activity pattern?

The following packages are used:
```{r}
library("ggplot2", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")
library("date", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")
library("ggplot2", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")
library("plyr", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")
 options(max.print=1000)
 unzip("activity.zip")
 echo = TRUE  # Always make code visible
options(scipen = 1)  # Turn off scientific notations for numbers
```


The following code opens the file on my computer and sets the working directory:
```{r}
setwd("/home/david/Documents/dataScience/coursera/reproducible research/project1")
      ACtivit<- read.csv("activity.csv")


```


The following code is designed to anser the following question: What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}


sumstep<-aggregate(ACtivit[,1],by = list(ACtivit[,2]), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
      stepgraph<-qplot(sumstep[,2], xlab="number of steps per 5 minutes")
      plot(stepgraph+geom_histogram())
meastep<-mean(sumstep[,2])

medstep<-median(sumstep[,2])
paste("Median steps per day ", medstep, ". Mean steps per day ", meastep, sep="")
```

The following code is designed to answer the following question: What is the average daily activity pattern and what time in the day has the greatest average number of steps (mean and median)? 
First the mean steps in each time intervial:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
tsteps<-sumstep<-aggregate(ACtivit[,1],by = list(ACtivit[,3]), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(tsteps[,1],tsteps[,2],type="l",xlab="time since midnight", ylab="Mean steps")
mtsteps<-tsteps[tsteps[,2]==max(tsteps[,2]),]
paste("The 5 minute intervial with the greatest mean number of steps is ", mtsteps[,1])
```
Now the median steps in each time intervial:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
tsteps2<-sumstep2<-aggregate(ACtivit[,1],by = list(ACtivit[,3]), FUN=median, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(tsteps2[,1],tsteps2[,2],type="l",xlab="time since midnight", ylab="Median steps")
mdsteps<-tsteps2[tsteps2[,2]==max(tsteps2[,2]),]
paste("The 5 minute intervial with the greatest median number of steps is ", mdsteps[,1])
```


The following code is designed to answer the following questions: How many missing values are there in the dataset, and what happens if those missing values are replaced with the median for that 5 minute intervial?
```{r}
msstep<-sum(is.na(ACtivit[,1]))
paste("There are ", msstep, "'NA' values in the data")

ACT2<-ACtivit
for (i in 1:length(ACT2[,1])) {
        if (is.na(ACT2[i,1]) )        {       ACT2[i,1]<-tsteps2[tsteps2[,1]==ACT2[i,3],2]  }
        }

        
        
msumstep2<-aggregate(ACT2[,1],by = list(ACT2[,2]), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
      stepgraph2<-qplot(msumstep2[,2])
      plot(stepgraph2+geom_histogram())
meastep2<-mean(msumstep2[,2])

medstep2<-median(msumstep2[,2])
paste("Median steps per day ", medstep2, ". Mean steps per day ", meastep2, sep="")        
        
```

There was no change in the median value for the whole as a result of replacing the NAs with the median value for the day but there was an increase in the mean value for the whole data set as a result of replacing the NAs with the median value for the 5 minute period.
```{r, echo=FALSE}


ACT3<-ACtivit
for (i in 1:length(ACT3[,1])) {
        if (is.na(ACT3[i,1]) )               ACT3[i,1]<-tsteps[tsteps[,1]==ACT3[i,3],2]
        }

        
        
msumstep3<-aggregate(ACT3[,1],by = list(ACT3[,2]), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
      stepgraph3<-qplot(msumstep3[,2])
      plot(stepgraph3+geom_histogram())
meastep3<-mean(msumstep3[,2])

medstep3<-median(msumstep3[,2])
paste("Median steps per day ", medstep3, ". Mean steps per day ", meastep3, sep="")        
        
```



The following code is designed to answer the following questions: how does behavior differ by day of the week:

```{r}
wday<-ACT2
wday[,2]<-weekdays(as.Date(wday[,2],"%Y-%m-%d"))
wday[,2]<-gsub("Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday",1,wday[,2],perl=TRUE)
wday[,2]<-gsub("Saturday|Sunday",0,wday[,2],perl=TRUE)
meanNwday<-aggregate(wday[,1],by = list(wday[,2]), FUN=mean)

meanNwday
paste("Mean steps per 5 minute intervial on weekday ",meanNwday[2,2],". Mean steps per 5 minute intervial on weekend ",meanNwday[1,2],".",sep="")
meanwday2<-aggregate(wday[,1],by = list(wday[,2],wday[,3]), FUN=mean)
meanwday2<-rename(meanwday2,replace=c("Group.1"="week"))
meanwday2<-rename(meanwday2,replace=c("Group.2"="TimeIntervial"))


meanwday2[,1]<-gsub("end",1,meanwday2[,1],perl=TRUE)
meanwday2[,1]<-gsub("Weekday",0,meanwday2[,1],perl=TRUE)


dayt<-split(meanwday2, f=meanwday2$week)
wend<-dayt[[1]]
wdays<-dayt[[2]]

par(mfcol=c(1,2))



plot(wend$TimeIntervial,wend$x, col="red",type="l", ylab="steps during weekend",xlab  ="5 minute intervials")
plot(wdays$TimeIntervial,wdays$x, col="red",type="l", xlab = "5 minute intervials",lab="steps during weekday")
```

So ithe mean steps per 5 minute intervial on the weekend is higher
